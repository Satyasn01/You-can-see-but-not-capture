# üö´ You Can See but Not Capture

Welcome to "You Can See but Not Capture," a React application designed to detect specific objects, such as cell phones, in real-time using the webcam feed. Built with TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD, this application aims to enhance privacy and security by identifying and responding to the presence of unauthorized devices.

## üåê Overview

This application uses machine learning to monitor live video streams for the presence of cell phones, triggering a response when such devices are detected. It's an ideal solution for security-sensitive environments where camera use should be restricted.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD to detect cell phones in real-time through a webcam feed.
- **Privacy Protection**: Automatically obscures the screen when a cell phone is detected, preventing camera-based information capture.
- **Customizable Responses**: Easily modify the response actions to fit specific security needs or environments.
- **Webcam Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with webcams using the React Webcam package.
- **Minimalist Interface**: Features a clean, user-friendly interface that does not distract from the main functionality.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing application state.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Empowers the application with machine learning capabilities.
- **COCO-SSD Model**: Used for object detection within the video feed.
- **Webcam Component**: Captures video input from users' webcams.

## üöÄ Installation
